## Overview

This is a simple shopping list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing shopping items efficiently. The application heavily relies on DOM manipulation to provide seamless interaction and dynamic updates.

## Features

1. **Add New Item:** Users can add a new item to the list via a form. Duplicate items won't be added to ensure the list remains organized.
2. **Remove Item:** Items can be removed easily by clicking on the 'X' button associated with each item.
3. **Clear All Items:** Users can clear the entire list with a single click using the 'Clear All' button.
4. **Filter Items:** A filter input field allows users to search and filter items based on their names.
5. **Edit Existing Items:** Clicking on an existing item puts it into 'edit mode', enabling users to update the item's details. The changes can be saved by clicking the 'Update item' button.
6. **Local Storage Integration:** All additions and removals of items are synced with the local storage, ensuring that the data persists even after page refreshes or sessions are closed.
